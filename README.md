# How It's Made:
Tech Used: Java, JavaFX, SQLite<br>
Built an animal trivia maze game called Zoology Quest. You can choose the difficulty from the options. Depending on difficulty you can get easier or harder questions and the rate of questions is based on difficulty. There are a variety of questions with three formats which are short answer, true or false, and multiple choice. The maze is randomly generated so each time you play the maze will be random. You will be placed at the top left corner at every start. The maze has multiple doors which lead to rooms, when you open a door the door has a question behind it before you can proceed to the room. If you get the question correct you can proceed. If you get the question wrong you will lose health and have to reattempt or choose a different door. When you reattempt the same door, the question will not change just to give you a chance. When you start the game there is music playing as well, which you can turn off with the key 'Q'.
